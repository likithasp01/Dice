## How It Works:
- JavaScript picks a random number between 1–6 for each player
- Corresponding dice images are displayed
- Title updates to show the winner or a draw

Every time you *refresh the page*, two dice are rolled:
- One for *Player 1*
- One for *Player 2*

Based on the result:
- 🎉 If Player 1's dice is greater → *Player 1 Wins*
- 🏆 If Player 2's dice is greater → *Player 2 Wins*
- 🤝 If both dice are equal → *It's a Draw*
